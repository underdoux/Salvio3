### Execution Strategy to Continue Development

1. **Prioritize Phase 2 Development:**
   - Begin with master data management modules (Users, Customers, Categories, Products).
   - Implement CRUD with validation, soft-delete, and search features.
   - Ensure UI consistency by reusing existing layout and components.

2. **Integrate BPOM Data Scraping (Phase 2B):**
   - Develop scraper as a helper module.
   - Create controller and views for search and results.
   - Store scraped data in dedicated table.
   - Integrate auto-fill in product forms with fallback to manual entry.

3. **Plan for Phases 3 to 8:**
   - Design database schema and UI wireframes for sales, pricing, profit sharing, suppliers, reporting, and notifications.
   - Implement modules incrementally, ensuring testing and security at each step.
   - Use modular coding practices to maintain scalability.

4. **Development Workflow:**
   - Use version control with feature branches.
   - Write unit and integration tests.
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
   - Maintain detailed documentation and update logs regularly.

5. **Security and Performance:**
   - Enforce input validation and sanitization.
   - Implement CSRF and XSS protections.
   - Optimize database queries and caching.
   - Monitor application logs and performance metrics.
